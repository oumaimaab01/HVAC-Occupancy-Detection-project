<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to apply different ML and DL algorithms HVAC Occupancy on dataset. In
fact, by using environmental observations such as temperature, humidity and CO2 level. This
predictions might help Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) sector to predict
room occupancy. In this project, several performance of ML & DL techniques in
Occupancy classification have been used, in addition to the comparison between these different classification algorithms to conclude which distinctly outperforms the others.

What is the effectiveness of using machine learning in occupancy detection for HVAC systems ?

The integration of machine learning for occupancy detection in HVAC systems represents a significant advancement for more efficient energy management. By analyzing environmental data, this approach allows for the anticipation of occupant presence, thereby facilitating real-time adjustment of HVAC parameters. This dynamic adaptation helps minimize unnecessary energy consumption, thus improving the environmental sustainability of buildings while ensuring optimal comfort when spaces are indeed occupied.
